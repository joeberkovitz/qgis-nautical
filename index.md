### Things to download

[NOAA QGIS Template Project](NOAA-Template.qgz)
This QGIS project includes useful components to get started creating high-quality nautical charts based on NOAA raster marine charts. It includes the following:

- **NOAA seamless marine chart layer**. This layer automatically loads raster
tiles from NOAA's web server for marine charts in any area for which they are
available.

- **Sample chart layouts**.  A set of sample layouts is ready-made for
duplication in 11x17 landscape and portrait. Each layout has a map, title,
scale bar and lat/long grid.

- **Magnetic grid layers**. A group of layers supplying magnetic grid lines in
various declinations as per 2021. Currently available for New England and the
West Coast only.

- **Auto-labelled route layers**.  A set of route vector layers at various
declinations will automatically label each line with its distance and magnetic
bearing.
